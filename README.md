# GAN Models
Implementation of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with keras. With application on Yelp photo generation.

This repo implements the algorithm in the following 3 papers:

- DCGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
- Wasserstein GAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
- Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028)
 
See the [examples folder](./examples) for how to apply the model on MNIST and Yelp photos.
